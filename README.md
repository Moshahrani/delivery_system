# Delivery System

WGUPS faces challenges in consistently meeting package delivery deadlines. Students are tasked with creating an algorithm to route delivery trucks efficiently, considering specific delivery requirements and constraints.

Requirements:

Deliver 40 packages daily, each with unique criteria and deadlines.
Utilize three trucks and two drivers, ensuring all packages are delivered on time.
Keep the combined total distance traveled by all trucks under 140 miles.


Key Considerations:

Each truck can carry a maximum of 16 packages.
Trucks travel at an average speed of 18 miles per hour.
Drivers begin their routes at 8:00 a.m., with the day concluding once all packages are delivered.
